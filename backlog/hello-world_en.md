# Hi There ðŸ‘‹ !

My name is Thiago and this is my very first post ever !

## Who am I

I am just an ordinary guy that when I was a child, as most of the kids, wanted to be a lot of things "when I grew up". As most of my family (uncles and aunts, especially) were dentists and my father's work was related to it, I had in my mind that I would go to the dental university. Since my father bought our first computer, I got in love with it. Before high school, I was already programming, just for fun. I didn't know that I could have a career that leads me to do these fun things all day until my cousin entered a Computer Science university and from that moment I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up (that was a kind of achievement, no ? ðŸ˜Š). 

## Motivation to write

So here I am, some years late, enjoying the ride as much as I can (life is a rollercoaster, there are days you are just going down ðŸ˜…). I get into university (not Computing Science, but Computing Applied Mathematics) and started to work in IT while still in there. Passed for a few companies, working in different technologies and languages (from Cobol and C to JavaScript, passing, of course, by the Java world). Right now I am working with Web Components (Polymer and LitElement basically) and I am really loving it, trying to learn as much as I can.

I also started to attend meetups and events and enjoyed being there, seeing people sharing what they know. I always liked to share and help my work colleagues, so why not expand this to the community? 

## Publications

That is why I am starting to write here. My idea is to post regularly, sharing as much as possible (from things I know to what I just learned). I hope this would be helpful for someone (at least it will be for me, to write it down and have somewhere to check it later ðŸ˜ƒ). I will try to write in the 3 languages I know (or believe I know ðŸ˜œ ) aiming to be more inclusive with it. I will write the posts in Portuguese (my native language), English and Spanish. Thank for understand any misspelling or error in those languages. These posts will be published in my GitHub, so feel free to send me a PR!

In my next posts, ðŸ”œ I will do a guide on how I set up my computer, from installing a new browser and its extensions until it is ready to start development, going through the terminal plugins I use, the software I have installed, general configuration, etc.

## Thank you!

Hope you have enjoyed reading this first ever post  and hope to see you soon !
